## Key Features

- **Face Recognition & Profile Personalization**  
  Users are identified through face recognition using local face encoding combined with cloud-based recognition via AWS Rekognition, enabling personalized dashboards and experiences.

- **Remote Profile & Reminder Management**  
  Guardians or family members can create user profiles and schedule reminders through the mobile app, which are displayed directly on the mirror.

- **"Wind Guardian" – Smart Climate Awareness**  
  Room temperature and humidity are continuously monitored, and cooling fans are automatically triggered when unusual or uncomfortable conditions are detected.

- **AI Persona Interaction**  
  An AI-powered conversational persona allows users—especially elderly individuals—to interact naturally using voice, providing companionship and easy access to information.

- **Presence & Gesture-Based Control**  
  Radar-based presence detection wakes the system automatically, while gesture and voice controls enable fully hands-free interaction.

- **Smart Daily Services**  
  Displays calendar events, weather updates, emails, and music playback, helping users make productive use of time while getting ready.

## Mobile App & Cloud Connectivity

- **Companion Mobile App**  
  Built using Flutter, the mobile app provides a cross-platform interface for profile management, reminder scheduling, and remote monitoring.

- **Cloud Integration**  
  The system uses AWS S3 for image storage and AWS Rekognition for cloud-based facial recognition, ensuring secure and scalable identity management.

- **Remote Interaction**  
  Guardians can manage user profiles, send reminders, and control mirror features remotely through secure cloud APIs.
